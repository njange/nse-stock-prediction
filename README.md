## Introduction
The NSE Stock Prediction project utilizes historical stock data to forecast future stock prices. The project leverages various machine learning algorithms to analyze trends and make predictions.

## Features
- Data collection from NSE
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Model evaluation and selection
- Visualization of stock price predictions

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/njange/nse-stock-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd nse-stock-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the dataset:
    - Ensure you have the historical stock data in the `data` directory.
